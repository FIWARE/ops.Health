# COMMAND DEFINITIONS
# Command definitions that this daemon will run.  Definitions
# are in the following format:
#
# command[<command_name>]=<command_line>
#
# When the daemon receives a request to return the results of <command_name>
# it will execute the command specified by the <command_line> argument.
#
# Unlike Nagios, the command line cannot contain macros - it must be
# typed exactly as it should be executed.
#
# Note1: Any plugins that are used in the command lines must reside on the
# machine that this daemon is running on! Also note that you will have to
# modify the definitions below to match the argument format the plugins expect.
#
# Note2: File paths may vary depending on GNU/Linux distribution. CentOS/RedHat
# usually install plugins at /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins.
#
# The following definitions include user-supplied arguments and can only
# be used if the NRPE daemon was compiled with support for command arguments
# *AND* the dont_blame_nrpe directive in NRPE config file is set to '1'. This
# poses a potential security risk, so make sure you read the SECURITY file
# before doing this.
